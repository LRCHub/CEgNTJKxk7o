```
On a grassy knoll
with a rifle in hand
Cupid cleans his little scope
and calmly aims at a man
He had no plans of fallin',
dreams of ballin'
Glorified call-girls callin'
Numb to strength,
loves endorphins
Lust engulfin', yeah,
I'm lost in here
But I'll find my way, I swear
Through all the fog, I stare
Dropped off this cross I bear
And chopped off my head
And tossed it back there somewhere
Now I'm headed home, my dear
And I brought a poem to share
And here's what it say
Love is a candle wick in rain
After the storm,
we're still aflame
Oh, I love,
love has been called a losin' game
But the more that I love,
the more I gain
Oh, woah (Ooh)
